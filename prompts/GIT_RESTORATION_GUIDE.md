# üîÑ GIT RESTORATION GUIDE - Universal Product Scraper

**Generated**: August 16, 2025  
**Purpose**: Guide Claude to help restore application to specific commit points  
**Usage**: Ask Claude to "read prompts/GIT_RESTORATION_GUIDE.md" when restoration needed  

---

## üö® **USER RESTORATION REQUEST PROTOCOL**

When you want to restore the application to a previous state, simply ask Claude:

### **Basic Restoration Request:**

```
"Read prompts/GIT_RESTORATION_GUIDE.md and help me restore to [COMMIT_TYPE]"
```

### **Request Types:**

#### **Option A: Restore to Specific Functionality**

```
"Restore to the last working state before CLI changes"
"Restore to clean core without authentication"  
"Restore to basic scraper without Excel enhancements"
```

#### **Option B: Restore to Specific Commit Hash**

```
"Restore to commit 5cc192d"
"Restore to commit 72949f8"
```

#### **Option C: Show Available Restore Points**

```
"Show me available restore points with descriptions"
"What are the major checkpoint commits I can restore to?"
```

---

## ü§ñ **CLAUDE RESPONSE PROTOCOL**

When this guide is read, Claude MUST follow this exact protocol:

### **STEP 1: SAFETY CHECK**

```bash
# Always check current status first
git status
git log --oneline -10
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: If there are uncommitted changes, STOP and ask:

```
"You have uncommitted changes. Do you want to:
1. Save current work as a new commit before restoring
2. Discard current changes and restore  
3. Cancel restoration"
```

### **STEP 2: SHOW AVAILABLE RESTORE POINTS**

Present this table with ACTUAL commit data:

```
üéØ AVAILABLE RESTORE POINTS:

| Commit | Date | Description | What You Get Back |
|--------|------|-------------|------------------|
| [HASH] | [DATE] | [DESCRIPTION] | [FUNCTIONALITY] |
| [HASH] | [DATE] | [DESCRIPTION] | [FUNCTIONALITY] |
```

**Key Restore Points to ALWAYS Show:**

- **LATEST CHECKPOINT**: Most recent stable state
- **PRE-CLI ARCHITECTURE**: Before CLI modifications
- **CLEAN CORE COMPLETION**: Core functionality complete  
- **SCORING ENHANCEMENT**: Updated scoring system
- **AUTHENTICATION ADDITION**: Before auth system

### **STEP 3: RESTORATION RECOMMENDATION**

Based on user request, recommend:

```
üéØ RECOMMENDED RESTORE POINT:

Commit: [HASH] - [DESCRIPTION]
Date: [DATE]
Why: [EXPLANATION]

This will restore:
‚úÖ [FEATURE 1]
‚úÖ [FEATURE 2] 
‚úÖ [FEATURE 3]

You will lose:
‚ùå [FEATURE 1]
‚ùå [FEATURE 2]
```

### **STEP 4: EXECUTE RESTORATION** (Only after user confirmation)

**Safe Restoration Commands:**

```bash
# Method 1: Hard reset (DESTRUCTIVE - use only if confirmed)
git reset --hard [COMMIT_HASH]

# Method 2: Create new branch from restore point (SAFE)
git checkout -b restored-[DATE] [COMMIT_HASH]

# Method 3: Merge restore point (SAFEST)
git checkout -b merge-restore [COMMIT_HASH]
git checkout main
git merge merge-restore
```

**Always use Method 2 (new branch) unless user specifically requests destructive reset**

### **STEP 5: VERIFY RESTORATION**

After restoration, ALWAYS verify:

```bash
# Check restoration was successful
git log --oneline -5
git status

# Test critical functionality
python production_scraper.py --rows 126
```

**Report to user:**

```
‚úÖ RESTORATION COMPLETE

Current state: [COMMIT_HASH] - [DESCRIPTION]
Branch: [BRANCH_NAME]
Functionality verified: [TEST_RESULTS]

Next steps:
1. Test your key workflows
2. If satisfied, continue development
3. If not satisfied, we can restore to different point
```
