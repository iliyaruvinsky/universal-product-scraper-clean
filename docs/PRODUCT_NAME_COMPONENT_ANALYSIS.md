## 📊 **SCORING SYSTEM WEIGHTS (UPDATED AUGUST 2025)**

### **OPTION_1 Component Scoring Weights:**

**Updated Scoring Distribution:**
```text
├─ Manufacturer: 10% (0-1.0 points) - REDUCED from 15%
├─ Model Name: 40% (0-4.0 points) - DECREASED from 65% 
├─ Model Number: 50% (0-5.0 points) - INCREASED from 20%
└─ Maximum Score: 10.0 points total
```

**Validation Threshold:**
```text
├─ Phase 4 Threshold: ≥8.0/10.0 (80% minimum) - INCREASED from 6.0/10.0
├─ Phase 7 Threshold: ≥8.0/10.0 (80% minimum) - Same as Phase 4
└─ Excel Validation: ≥8.0/10.0 (80% minimum) - Consistent across all phases
```

**Scoring Rationale:**
```text
1. Model Number Priority: Exact model matching is most critical (50%)
2. Model Name Balance: Reasonable weight for name similarity (40%) 
3. Manufacturer Reduced: Less weight on manufacturer matching (10%)
4. Higher Standards: 80% threshold ensures better quality matches
```
